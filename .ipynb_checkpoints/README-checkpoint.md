# Data Analytics Capstone

I want to do a time series analysis by pulling data from speedrun.com. I believe i should pick around 10 games (that are also in steam), pull their speed run times over time and analyze. I'd like to see if I can develop a test or a hypothesis from there on if we can predict how many speed runs it takes to get to a relative efficiency.

created a pull to grab run data, and plotted it to see trends.
